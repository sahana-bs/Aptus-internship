# Aptus-internship
jun- july 2018.
Work done as a part of the internship in the area of cybersecurity. 
Data about threat actors, their country of origin, targets, modus openandi... blogs by leading cybersecurity firms, companies offering threat intellegence, antivirus softwares were very resourceful. I have mentioned some of them in the "resources". Surprisingly, Dark web also proved to be a haven of information regarding potential threat actors. The key dataset I used was from Florian Roth's blog (https://goo.gl/TyPmMe) in addition to the data I had collected.
To visualise this dataset, I used ELK stack. A great tool, especially if you're dealing with logs. Couldn't mess a lot because it was textual data.
